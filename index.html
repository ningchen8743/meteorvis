      <br> <br>
    
      <p> Nick Bostrom has a very interesting paper called “Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority.” The basic intuition is that preventing even small risks of human extinction is worthwhile if we consider all the human generations it would save. One way to start saving all those future lives might be by digging into this data set of every recorded meteor impact on Earth from 2500 BCE to 2012.</p>

      <h4> <mark>Meteorite "Falls" vs. "Finds" </mark> </h4>

      <br> 
      <p> <a href="https://www.permanent.com/meteorites-falls-finds.html">Finds </a> are meteorites which were found on the ground unrelated to any sighting, due to the finder recognizing them to be clearly identifiable as being of nonterritorial origin. <a href="https://www.psi.edu/epo/faq/meteor.html">Falls </a> are meteorites which were seen to fall from the sky and which were tracked down successfully.To date, there have been nearly 1,100 recovered falls (meteorites seen to fall) and nearly 40,000 finds (found, but not seen to fall). It is estimated that probably 500 meteorites reach the surface of the Earth each year, but less than 10 are recovered. <u> <b>This is because most fall into the ocean, land in remote areas of the Earth, land in places that are not easily accessible, or are just not seen to fall (fall during the day). </b></u></p>

     <br> <br> 

      <h4> <mark>How frequent do meteorite falls occur each year? </mark></h4>
      <br> 
      <p>Our best estimates of the total incoming meteoroid flux indicate that about 10 to 50 meteorite dropping events occur over the earth each day. It should be remembered, however, that 2/3 of these events will occur over ocean, while another 1/4 or so will occur over very uninhabited land areas, leaving only about 2 to 12 events each day with the potential for discovery by people. Half of these again occur on the night side of the earth, with even less chance of being noticed. 
        <a href="https://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/#10">Due to the combination of all of these factors, only a handful of witnessed meteorite falls occur Each year.</a></p>

    <br> <br> 

      <h4> <mark style='line-height: 1.7;'>How many meteors can I expect to see if I go out to observe for them <br> - when no meteor shower is occurring? </mark></h4>
      <br>   

      <p> The number of random, or “sporadic” meteors that can be seen in the night sky is quite variable, depending upon such factors as the time of night, time of year, light pollution, and cloud conditions. Perhaps the most important factors necessary in order to observe meteors are to have a clear, unobstructed view, out in the open, and under as dark sky conditions as possible. </p>

      <blockquote>
      We can’t see or track them down due to poor atmospheric clarity, or they are more likely been burned up due to thicker cloud conditions.

       <br>

       <p> The visualization presented was created using the </a href='https://meteoritical.org/'> Meteorological society </a> dataset. After publishing the dataset, the society produced the <a href="https://www.analyticbridge.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/registered-meteorites-that-has-impacted-on-earth-visualized">visualization </a> in Tableau. This initial visualization served as a quick visual overview and inspiration for some of the first sketches. Looking at the overview visualization, we can see a meteorite mass per year presented with a simple bar-chart.

       <br>  

      <p> Meteor events have varying degrees of impact on the earth. While small meteoroids and asteroids frequently scrape the earth's atmosphere with little to no consequences, major impact events caused by large astronomical objects, despite their rarity, can significantly shape the tracks of lives on earth.<br> <br>

      According to the research from American Meteor Society: About 10 to 50 meteorite dropping events occur over the earth each day. but only a handful of witnessed falls occur each year. This is because most meteorites fall into the ocean, land in remote areas of the Earth, or are just not seen to fall (fall during the day).
      <br><br>

      Previous records of epic meteor events make us wondering: Are we living in a meteor peak period? Are we getting better chance of seeing a splendid meteor shower?
      To understand the patterns of global meteor events, we investigated data from XXX with a time frame between BCE 2500 and CE 2012.
      <br><br>

      We decided to focus on two aspects: 
      1. The total mass per year. A bar chart was constructed in Tableau using year as filter, showing the sum of mass for each year.
      2. The amount ratio that were seen and were tracked down successfully : Fallen Percentage = Falls/(Falls + Finds)*100%
      "Finds": meteorites which were found on the ground unrelated to any sighting.
      "Falls": meteorites which were seen to fall from the sky and which were tracked down successfully.</p>
